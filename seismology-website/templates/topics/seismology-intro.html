                <p>
                    An earthquake is a natural phenomenon that occurs when there is a <i>sudden release of energy</i> in the Earth's crust, resulting in seismic 
                    waves that cause the ground to shake. This shaking can range from minor tremors that are barely noticeable to violent movements that can cause 
                    widespread destructions. They can have a wide range of effects, including ground shaking, surface rupture, landslides, 
                    tsunamis (if the earthquake occurs under the ocean), and damage to buildings and infrastructure. The severity of an earthquake's impact depends
                    on its magnitude (a measure of the energy released) and its depth, distance from the epicenter, and local geological conditions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Seismologists study earthquakes to better understand their causes, effects, and patterns. They use 
                    seismographs to measure the seismic waves generated by earthquakes and analyze the data to study the Earth's interior and predict potential 
                    future seismic activity.

            <div class="lead fs-5">
                <p>
                    <p>
                        Earthquakes are primarily caused by the movement of the <i>tectonic plates</i>, which make up the Earth's 
                        outer shell and float on the semi-fluid asthenosphere beneath them. These plates are in constant motion between one another due to the heat-driven
                        convection currents in the Earth's mantle. When the edges of these plates interact, they can grind against each other, pull apart, or collide. 
                        The stress and pressure that build up at these plate boundaries can be released suddenly and create an Earthquake. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        However, earthquakes can also originate from the movement along <i>active faults</i> within a single tectonic plate. Active faults are 
                        fractures in the Earth's crust that have experienced recent movement, and they can accumulate stress over time. When the 
                        stress along these faults becomes too great, the rocks can slip suddenly, generating seismic waves and causing an 
                        earthquake. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Lastly, other factors inducing earthquakes, are related to <i>Human activities</i>, such as mining, reservoir-induced seismicity (due to the filling of large reservoirs behind dams), and 
                        hydraulic fracturing (fracking).

                    The released energy travels through the earth material through the form of seismic waves. These waves carry valuable information about the 
                    Earth's interior structure and composition. Seismic waves can be mainly categorized into two type of waves: <i>body waves</i> and 
                    <i>surface waves</i>. Body waves are a type of seismic wave that travel through the Earth's interior, propagating within 
                    its solid layers. There are two main types of body waves: <i>P-waves</i> (primary or compressional waves) and <i>S-waves</i> 
                    (secondary or shear waves). 
                </p>   
                <p>
                    Compressional or P waves are the fastest seismic waves and are the first to be detected at a seismic
                    station after an earthquake event. They travel through solid and liquid materials. It's wave motion causes the particles in the rock to move 
                    in the same direction as the one that the wave is propagating. This movement is in the form of compression and expansion like a spring.
                </p>

                </div>
                <p>
                    Shear waves are another type of body waves that follow the P waves, that is they travel more slowly. They can only pass through solid 
                    materials, due to its wave motion that cause particles in the rock to move perpendicular to the direction of wave propagation. This 
                    movement is in a side-to-side or up-and-down motion, resembling the movement of a rope shaken from side to side. S-waves are responsible 
                    for the most severe shaking and structural damage after an earthuake. Due to its motion the S waves can be further classified to <i>SH</i> or
                    <i>horizontal shear</i> and <i>SV</i> or <i>vertical shear</i> waves. The SH waves have a horizontal shearing motion, causing particles to 
                    move side-to-side in a horizontal direction. This side-to-side motion is similar to the movement of a snake or a wriggling rope. The SV
                    waves have a vertical shearing motion, causing particles to move up and down in a vertical direction.

                    <i>Surface seismic waves</i> are a type of seismic wave that travels along the Earth's surface rather than propagating through 
                    its interior. These waves are produced by the complex interactions of primary (P-waves) and secondary (S-waves) waves with the 
                    Earth's surface. Surface waves have a distinct rolling and swaying motion that is often likened to the movement of ocean 
                    waves. They move slower than P-waves and S-waves but can have larger amplitudes, making them particularly impactful during 
                    earthquakes. Surface waves are responsible for much of the ground shaking and damage experienced in seismic events. There are 
                    two main types of surface waves: <i>Love waves</i>, which have a side-to-side motion resembling a snake's slither, and 
                    <i>Rayleigh waves</i>, which produce an elliptical, rolling motion.

                    Seismic waves are generated at a <i>source</i>, <i>focus</i> or <i>hypocenter</i>, which can be natural, such as an earthquake or artificial, such as an explosion. 
                    The generated waves travel through the earth medium and are recorded at a <i>receiver</i>. The receiver is known as the <i>seismometer</i>
                    and the record of the ground motion at the seismometer is called the <i>seismogram</i>. A seismogram, contains information 
                    about both the source and the medium. The earth <i>medium</i>, or subsurface, refers to the material through which seismic waves travel, 
                    which can include rock layers, soil, and fluids.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If the origin time when the waves left the source is known, their arrival time at the receiver gives the <i>travel time</i> required
                    to pass through the medium. This time gives information about the speed at which they traveled and generally about the physical 
                    properties of the medium. In addition because the amplitude of the waves are affected by the medium, the signals observed on 
                    seismograms provide additional information about the portion of the earth that the waves traveled through.

                <p>
                    The seismic waves can be highly affected by the <i>underground geology</i>, a phenomenon known as <i>site effect</i>. Underground 
                    geology has to do with the composition and the arrangement of rock formations beneath the Earth's surface. It plays a crucial role 
                    in determining how seismic waves propagate and reflect, helping scientists interpret subsurface features and identify potential 
                    hazards.

                <p>
                    The distance between the source and the station that recorded the earthquake is known as <i>Hypocentral Distance</i>. It provides 
                    information about the direct path that seismic waves take to reach an observation point. On the other hand, 
                    <i>Epicentral Distance</i> measures the distance from the <i>epicenter</i>, which is the point directly above the hypocenter on the 
                    Earth's surface, to the station. These distances are essential in assessing the intensity and impact of seismic events, aiding in 
                    understanding their effects on structures and communities.

                <p>
                    In addition to the recorded direct P and S waves, there are other related waves that arise from the interactions of the seismic 
                    waves with the various layers and boundaries within the Earth. These phases play a crucial role in unraveling the Earth's 
                    intricate internal structure. For instance, there is a phase of the compressional (P) waves that can occur after the direct P wave 
                    reflects the surface and then is recorded at the receiver (PP). Another, happens when then P wave reflects the outer core and then 
                    end up at the receiver (PcP) or when the P wave travels through the mantle, the outer and the inner core and then ends up at the 
                    surface (PKIKP). Similarly, there are also the direct shear (S) waves and its phases. For example the S wave reflected off the
                    surface of the earth and then recorded has a phase of SS, analogous to PP.

                <p>
                    Faults are the main source of the earthquakes. During a fault rupture, one side of the fault moves with respect to the other 
                    side. The upper or overlying block along the fault plane (assuming that a fault is a planar surface) is called the 
                    <i>hanging wall</i> and the block below is called the <i>footwall</i>. According to H. Reid, the fault rupture follows the 
                    elastic rebound theory that is the friction between the two blocks prevents them from sliping until the strain is so large 
                    that there is a sudden and steep movement that causes the earthquake.

                <p>
                    To describe the geometry of a fault, we need to assume that a fault is a planar surface across which relative motion accurs 
                    during an earthquake. The coordinate axes used to describe the fault are the <code>X1</code> axis that is called the 
                    <i>strike</i> of the fault (the instersection of the fault plane with the surface), the <code>X2</code> axis that is 
                    perpedicular to the <code>X1</code> axis and <code>X3</code> axis and the <code>x3</code> axis that it points upward and is 
                    perpendicular to the other two. The fault geometry can be completely described using two different coordinate systems: 
                    a) <i>n</i>, <i>d</i> and b) <i>φf</i>, <i>δ</i>, <i>λ</i>. The first coordinate system uses the <i>normal</i> vector on the 
                    fault plane (n) and the perpendicular to the normal vector, the <i>slip</i> vector, that shows the direction of the hanging wall
                    block with respect to the footwall. The second one, consists of the <i>dip angle</i> <code>δ</code>, that is the orientation of 
                    the fault with respect to the surface, the counterclockwise measured <i>slip angle</i> <code>λ</code> measured from the

                    from the clockwise from the north to the <code>X1</code> axis.

                    We can categorize the faults into three categories, according to the <i>orientation</i> of the fault plane and the 
                    <i>direction</i> of the slip along the plane. Faults which move along the direction of the dip plane are <i>dip-slip</i> faults 
                    and described as either <i>normal</i> or <i>reverse</i> (<i>thrust</i>), depending on their motion. Faults which move 
                    horizontally are known as <i>strike-slip</i> faults and are classified as either <i>right-lateral</i> or <i>left-lateral</i>. 
                    Faults which show both dip-slip and strike-slip motion are known as <i>oblique-slip</i> faults.

                <p>
                    One of the foremost seismic hazard is the <i>shaking of the ground</i>.  When an earthquake happens, waves spread out from the source and move quickly through the Earth's outer layer. When these 
                    waves reach the surface, they cause the ground to shake, which can last a few seconds or even minutes. How much shaking occurs 
                    at a specific place depends on how big the earthquake is, where it happened, and the characteristics of that place. If an 
                    earthquake is large and close by, the shaking can be really strong and cause a lot of damage. Actually, most of the problems 
                    caused by earthquakes come from this shaking. If there's not much shaking, the other issues related to earthquakes might not 
                    be a big concern. But when the shaking is powerful, it can lead to various problems like landslides or collapsing 
                    buildings.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Undoubtedly, the most striking and unforgettable depictions of earthquake devastation are the <i>structural hazards</i>. 
                    From the anticipated collapse of poorly fortified masonry and adobe buildings, where numerous individuals in less developed 
                    regions reside, to the unexpected ruination of more contemporary constructions, structural impairment remains a primary factor 
                    contributing to both loss of life and financial setbacks in numerous seismic events. Yet, it's important to note that complete 
                    structural collapse isn't a prerequisite for causing harm and fatalities. In various earthquakes, casualties have resulted 
                    from objects falling—such as exterior brick facades and ledges, as well as heavy artworks and shelving within buildings.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some of the most remarkable instances of earthquake-related destruction have taken place when soil deposits lose their 
                    solidity and seem to transform into fluid-like substances. This occurrence, known as <i>liquefaction</i>, entails a 
                    significant reduction in the soil's strength, often to the extent that it's incapable of providing support to structures or 
                    retaining stability. Liquefaction is primarily observed in saturated soils, making it most prevalent in close proximity to 
                    rivers, bays, and other water bodies. The term "liquefaction" actually encompasses several connected phenomena. For instance, 
                    flow failures can transpire when the soil's strength dips below the threshold required for maintaining stability in stationary 
                    conditions. These flow failures result from the influence of gravitational forces at rest, and they can lead to extensive 
                    displacements.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Powerful earthquakes frequently trigger <i>landslides</i>. While most of these landslides are minor in scale, seismic events 
                    have also led to substantial slides. Regrettably, in certain instances, landslides triggered by earthquakes have completely 
                    covered towns and villages. More frequently, earthquake-triggered landslides cause harm by demolishing structures or 
                    disrupting bridges and other constructed structures. Numerous landslides induced by earthquakes are a consequence of 
                    liquefaction occurrences, but many others merely depict the collapse of slopes that were barely stable when at rest.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The rapid vertical movements of the seafloor due to fault ruptures during earthquakes can result in the formation of <i>tsunamis</i>, 
                    which are lengthy sea waves with extended periods. When in the open ocean, tsunamis cover vast distances at significant 
                    speeds, yet they are challenging to detect. Their usual height remains under 1 meter, while their wavelengths can span several 
                    hundred kilometers. However, as a tsunami nears the coastline, the reduction in water depth causes its speed to decrease and 
                    the wave's height to surge. In specific coastal regions, the seabed's configuration might amplify the wave, giving rise to an 
                    almost perpendicular wall of water that surges far inland, causing catastrophic devastation. When earthquakes generate waves 
                    in enclosed water bodies, these are referred to as <i>seiches</i>. Typically brought about by seismic waves with long periods that 
                    match the natural oscillation period of water within a lake or reservoir, seiches can manifest over extensive distances from 
                    the earthquake's source.

            <p class="main-block__title main-block__title--medium">Introduction</p>

            <p>
                &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspSeismic waves are generated at a <i>source</i>, which can be natural, such as an earthquake or artificial, 
                such as an explosion. The generated waves travel through the earth or in other words, through the <i>medium</i> and are recorded at a receiver. The receiver 
                is known as the <i>seismometer</i> and the record of the ground motion at the seismometer is called the <i>seismogram</i>. A seismogram, contains information 
                about both the source and the medium.
            </p>

            <img src="/static/img/seismology-intro-images/source-medium-receiver.png" alt="mseed record ASCII file" class="main-block__img main-block__img--large">

            <p>
                The generated seismic waves provide information on the location and the nature of the source. If 
                the origin time when the waves left the source is known, their arrival time at the receiver gives the travel time required to pass through the 
                medium. This time gives information about the speed at which they traveled and generally about the physical properties of the medium. In 
                addition because the amplitude of the waves are affected by the medium, the signals observed on seismograms provide additional information 
                about the portion of the earth that the waves traveled through.
            </p>

            <p class="main-block__title main-block__title--medium">Properties of the seismic waves</p>

            <p>
                &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspSeveral properties of the seismic waves are analogous to familiar concepts in the propagation of light and sound. One of 
                these properties is the <i>refraction</i>. Seismic wave velocities generally increase with depth. Because of the different 
                velocities at different depths, wave paths bend away from the vertical as they go deeper into the earth, eventually become 
                horizontal, turn upward, and return to the surface. The wave paths are thus used to infer the variation of seismic velocity,
                and hence the composition and physical properties of material, with depth in the earth. Another property is the <i>reflection</i>
                that occurs when a seismic wave travels to an interface, across which physical properties change, such as the boundary 
                between the earth's mantle and core. In addition to refraction and reflection, waves also undergo <i>diffraction</i> where 
                seismic waves bend around obstacles such as the earth's core.
            </p>

            <p class="main-block__title main-block__title--medium">Earthquakes</p>

            <p>
                &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe location of an earthquake is known as the <i>focus</i> or <i>hypocenter</i> and it can be found from the arrival times of seismic 
                waves recorded on seismometers at different sites. This location is often shown by the epicenter, the point on the earth's
                surface above the earthquake. The size of earthquakes is measured from the amplitude of the motion recorded on seismograms
                and given in terms of <i>magnitude</i> or <i>moment</i>.
            </p>

            <p class="main-block__title main-block__title--medium">Seismic phases</p>

            <p>
                &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspSeismograms are records of the motion of the ground resulting from the arrival of refracted, reflected and diffracted 
                seismic waves. The recorded ground motion is a vector and thus three different components are typically recorded 
                (north-south, east-west, up-down). The generated seismic waves consist of different type of waves. The <i>body waves</i> consist of
                the <i>P</i> or <i>compressional</i> waves that material moves back and forth in the direction in which the wave propagates and the <i>S</i> or 
                <i>shear waves</i> that the material moves at right angles to the propagation direction. P waves are faster that S waves thus the 
                first arriving pulse is a direct P wave. Different other phases of compressional waves can occur after the direct P waves, 
                for example when the wave reflects the surface and then is recorded at the receiver (PP), when then wave reflects the outer core and then end up at the receiver (PcP)
                or when the wave travels through the mantle, the outer and the inner core and then end up at the surface (PKIKP). Among the later arrivals on the seismogram are 
                shear wave phases including the direct arrival S and a shear phase SS that reflected off the surface, analogous to PP.  The large amplitude wave train that arrives 
                later signifies the arrival of different waves called <i>surface</i> waves. <i>Rayleigh</i> wave is an example of this wave. Such waves 
                propagate along paths close to the earth's surface.
